<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project is about implementing your own version of some of the Enumerable module methods in order to reinforce and apply ruby syntax.

The methods are rebuilt based on the specs at [ruby-doc.org](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.6.5/Enumerable.html) and are the following:

- #my_each

- #my_each_with_index

- #my_select

- #my_all?

- #my_any?

- #my_none?

- #my_count

- #my_map

- #my_inject


This project was linted with the provided rubocop configuration files.

The built Enumerable methods are inside the enumerables.rb file and some helper methods meant to decrease the complexity of the #my_inject module are located at the helpers.rb file.

This is also part of the [Odin project curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/advanced-building-blocks)

This project includes tests using RSpec, the tests are included in the spec folder.
